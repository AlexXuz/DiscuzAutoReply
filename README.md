The current function of the forum's automatic reply script is to find the post after the specified post ID and verify whether it exists one by one. If it exists, reply to the post. Interested friends can modify some source codes by themselves, which can easily realize the function of multiple accounts top the same post. At present, the function to be realized also includes automatic cookie acquisition, which can be done at some time
